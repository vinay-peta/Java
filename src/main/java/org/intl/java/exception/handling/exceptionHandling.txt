Throwable:
		  Throwable class is the super class of all Exceptions and Errors in the java language.
		  Only Throwable class and it's subclasses can be the argument type in 'catch' clause.

Error:
		- Indicates serious problem and we should not try to catch
		- Error(StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError), RuntimeException(and its subclasses), AIOB, NullPointerException are unchecked exceptions
Exception:
		- Indicates conditions which we might to catch

Checked Exceptions vs Unchecked Exceptions:
		- Exceptions which are checked by the compiler - checked exception
		- Exceptions which are not checked by the compiler - unchecked exception
		- Both checked/unchecked exception occurs at runtime
		
		- Error, RuntimeException(and its subclasses), AIOB, NullPointerException are unchecked exceptions
		- IOException, FileNotFoundException, Interrupted Exception(and its subclasses) are checked exceptions
		
		- Exception class is known as partially checked exception(It contains both checked and unchecked)
		
final vs finally vs finalize
		- final is a modifier applicable for classes, methods and variables
		- finally is a block associated with try catch to perform clean up code
		- JVM (Garbage collector) calls finalize method to perform clean up activities
		
throw
		- create an exception; we can use it only for Throwable types 
		- If if it a custom exception create a class which extends RunTimeException
		- throw should be the last statement in that loop; any line after throw is unreachable

throws
		- required only for checked exception
		- delegate the handling responsibility to caller method
